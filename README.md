# 🔥 Calorie Burnt Prediction – Machine Learning with XGBoost
This repository contains a Machine Learning project that predicts the number of calories burned based on individual physiological and exercise-related metrics. It uses XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, for high-accuracy predictions.

📁 Project Structure
Calorie_Burnt_Prediction.ipynb – Jupyter notebook that includes:

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Model training with XGBoost

Evaluation and visualization of predictions

💡 Features
Predicts calories burned using real-world physiological inputs.

Utilizes XGBoost Regressor for better performance over traditional models.

Clean and scalable preprocessing pipeline.

Visual insights using plots for model predictions vs actual values.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

XGBoost

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib & seaborn

📊 Dataset Used
Download the dataset from Kaggle:

Calories Burned Dataset

This includes two CSV files:

exercise.csv

calories.csv

Ensure both files are in the same folder as the notebook.
